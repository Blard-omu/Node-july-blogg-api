# Building API with Node.js: A Beginner's Guide
Node.js is a popular runtime environment for building server-side applications and APIs using JavaScript. In this beginner's guide, we'll walk through the steps to build a basic API with Node.js. We'll cover everything from setting up your development environment to creating an API that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Installing Node.js
Before you can start building a Node.js API, you need to install Node.js itself. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To check if Node.js has been successfully installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see the installed Node.js version displayed.

## Step 2: JavaScript in the Node.js Environment

Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. To access the Node.js environment, open your terminal or command prompt and type `node` followed by the `Enter` key. You can then run JavaScript code directly:

```javascript
> 5 + 8
13
> console.log("Hello, Node.js")
Hello, Node.js
```

To exit the Node.js environment, press `Ctrl + D` or type `.exit`.

## Step 4: The Global Object and Process

In Node.js, the `global` object serves as the global scope, somewhat similar to the `window` object in the browser environment. The `process` object provides information about the Node.js process, environment variables, and more.

To access the `global` object, simply type `global` in the Node.js environment:

```javascript
> global
```

## Step 5: Creating and Running Files in Node.js

You can create Node.js files with a `.js` extension. For example, create a file named `app.js` with the following content:

```javascript
console.log("Welcome to Node.js");
```

To execute the `app.js` file, open your terminal and navigate to the file's directory, then run:

```bash
node app.js
```

You will see the output: "Welcome to Node.js."

## Step 6: Import/Export Modules

Node.js uses the `module.exports` and `require` mechanism for code separation and modularization. You can split your code into multiple files and use them as modules.

In one file (e.g., `module1.js`), export a function:

```javascript
// module1.js
module.exports = function() {
  console.log("This is module 1");
};
```

In another file (e.g., `app.js`), require the module and use it:

```javascript
const module1 = require('./module1');
module1(); // This is module 1
```
This separation allows you to organize your code and reuse functions.

## Step 7: Node Core Modules

Node.js provides several core modules that can be used to perform various tasks. Some common core modules include `os` for operating system information, `path` for file path operations, `fs` for file system operations, and `http` for creating HTTP servers.

## Using Core Modules: `os`, `path`, `fs`, and `http`

### Using the `os` Module:
The `os` module provides information about the operating system. Here's an example of how to use it:

```javascript
const os = require('os');

console.log('Operating System:', os.platform());
console.log('CPU Architecture:', os.arch());
console.log('Total Memory (bytes):', os.totalmem());
console.log('Free Memory (bytes):', os.freemem());
```

### Using the `path` Module:
The `path` module is useful for working with file paths. Here's an example:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'folder', 'file.txt');
console.log('File Path:', filePath);
```

### Using the `fs` Module:
The `fs` module allows you to interact with the file system. Here's an example of reading a file:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File Content:', data);
});
```


## Step 8: Creating an HTTP Server

To create an HTTP server using Node.js, you can use the `http` core module. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, HTTP Server!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

## Step 9: Creating an Express Server

[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a popular web framework for Node.js that simplifies building web applications and APIs. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install express
```

And then create an Express server:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express Server!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Step 10: Separation of Routes, Controllers, and Models

For more complex applications, you should separate your code into different files, such as routes, controllers, models, etc. Express makes it easy to do this.

// Routes
- Routes define the endpoints of our API and specify the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) that can be used to access them.
e.g
- Blog routes:
GET /blog: Retrieve a list of all published posts
GET /blog/:post_id: Retrieve a single post by its ID

- Author routes: 
We want only authenticated users to have access to these routes and all of the CRUD operations.
GET /author/blog: Retrieve a list of all post published by a particular user.
POST /author/blog: Create a new post
PATCH /author/blog/edit/post_id: Update an post by its ID
PATCH /author/blog/edit/state/:post_id: Update an post's state
DELETE /author/blog/:post_id: Delete a post by its ID

- Auth routes: for managing user authentication.
POST /auth/signup: Register a new user
POST /auth/login: Log in an existing user

// Controllers
- Controllers contain the code for the controllers of our API. Controllers handle incoming requests and send responses to the client.
A controller is a function that is called when a route is matched, and it is responsible for handling the request and sending the response.

- Models 
A data model is a representation of the data that will be stored in the database and the relationships between that data. We'll be using Mongoose to define our schema.


## Step 11: Creating Models with Mongoose

If you're building a database-driven API, [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is a popular library for working with MongoDB. You can define models and schemas for your data.

## Step 12: Connecting to a Database (MongoDB)

Connect your Node.js application to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library. You'll need to set up a database, create a connection, and define models to interact with your data.

## Step 13: Testing API Endpoints with Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a great tool for testing your API endpoints. It allows you to send HTTP requests to your server and inspect the responses.

## Step 14: CRUD Operations Explained

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are fundamental in API development. You'll need to implement these operations to interact with your data effectively.

## Basic Routes for CRUD Operations

In this section, we'll create a simple Express application with routes for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of items.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Sample data
let items = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
];

// Middleware to parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Create a new item
app.post('/items', (req, res) => {
  const newItem = req.body;
  items.push(newItem);
  res.status(201).json(newItem);
});

// Read all items
app.get('/items', (req, res) => {
  res.json(items);
});

// Read a specific item by ID
app.get('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const item = items.find((i) => i.id === id);
  if (item) {
    res.json(item);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send('Item not found');
  }
});

// Update an item by ID
app.put('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const updatedItem = req.body;
  const index = items.findIndex((i) => i.id === id);
  if (index !== -1) {
    items[index] = updatedItem;
    res.json(updatedItem);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send('Item not found');
  }
});

// Delete an item by ID
app.delete('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const index = items.findIndex((i) => i.id === id);
  if (index !== -1) {
    items.splice(index, 1);
    res.sendStatus(204);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send('Item not found');
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

This Express application defines routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items. You can test these routes using a tool like Postman or by making HTTP requests in your browser.


## Step 15: Building a Blog API (Project)

As a hands-on project, you can build a simple blog API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This will involve creating routes for blog posts, user authentication, and data storage.
